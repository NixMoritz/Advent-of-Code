# Advent of Code 🎄

Welcome to my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges!  
This repository contains solutions implemented in [Go](https://golang.org/).

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event featuring daily programming challenges during the Advent season (December 1st–25th). Each day provides a unique problem that tests logical thinking, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```text
.
├── 2024
   ├── Day1/
   │   ├── main.go        # Solutions for the day
   ├── Day2/
   │   ├── main.go        # Solutions for the day
   └──  README.md             # README for the year

```

- Each day is located in its own directory.
- Puzzle inputs are not allowed to be shared.
- Solutions will be split into `part1.go` and `part2.go` for clarity.

## Running the Code

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NixMoritz/Advent-of-Code.git
   cd Advent-of-Code
   ```

2. Navigate to the day's folder:

   ```bash
   cd {year}
   ```

3. Navigate to the day's folder:

   ```bash
   cd day{n}
   ```

4. Run the solution for main:

   `don't forget to get your input data for the day`

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Utilities

Shared functions used across multiple days are located in the `common/` directory. These include utilities for parsing input, working with strings and numbers, and other helper functions.
