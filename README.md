# Advent of Code 🎄

Welcome to my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges!  
This repository contains solutions implemented in [Go](https://golang.org/).  

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual event featuring daily programming challenges during the Advent season (December 1st–25th). Each day provides a unique problem that tests logical thinking, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure
Change of format inevtiable  
The repository is organized as follows: 


```
.
├── Task_1/
│   ├── main.go        # Solutions for the day
├── Task_2/
│   ├── main.go        # Solutions for the day 
├── README.md
└── go.mod              # Go module file
```

- Each day is located in its own directory.
- Puzzle inputs are not allowed to be shared.
- Solutions will be split into `part1.go` and `part2.go` for clarity.

## Running the Code
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NixMoritz/AoC_2024.git
   cd AoC_2024
   ```

2. Navigate to the day's folder:
   ```bash
   cd Task_n
   ```

3. Run the solution for main:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Utilities
Shared functions used across multiple days are located in the `common/` directory. These include utilities for parsing input, working with strings and numbers, and other helper functions.
